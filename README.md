The project is an Android app written in Java on Android Studio that guides users touring sites of interest at District Six.
The app provides a map and navigation capabilities through the tour and once the user arrives at a site, they can access information about it in the form of images, video, and text.
The aim of the tour is to educate users about the District Six removals by the Apartheid government.
